# NaturalMergeSort
Write a program for storting data in disk files using one of the following algorithms: natural merge
sort, polyphase merge sort or merging with large buffers. “Tapes” should be implemented as disk files.
Block access to files should be implemented (simulated) as a separate program layer with an
appropriate interface to the higher layer containing operations for reading and writing separate records.
Program should enable both randomly generating the records to be sorted or imputting them through
the keyboard. The records to be sorted should be displayed both before and after sorting. Optionally
they should be displayed after each phase. At the end, the number of sort phases, the number of disk
blocks read from the disk and the number of disk blocks written onto the disk should be displayed.
Additionally, the created programs should be able to read test data from files.
